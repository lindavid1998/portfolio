This project is a single page React application and is my portfolio. It displays my experience and projects as it pertains to software engineering.

I would like to revamp my portfolio. The goal is to provide a clean and readable UI that showcases my skills. The website should load quickly and have a smooth user experience

Project structure
- Images and other static assets are contained in /src/assets
- UI components are stored in /components

Styling theme
- Use a dark theme

Data should be hardcoded as there is no backend. Please create a separate data file. This should store project and work experience that the UI components consume.

My skills that I want to higlight: TypeScript, Python, SQL, React, Node.js, Next.js, PostgreSQL

Tech Stack:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
